I'm going to state the loop invariant as:
	At the start of each iteration of the for loop, the subarray A[1..i−1] consists of elements that are different than ν.	

Initialization
Initially the subarray is the empty array, so proving it is trivial.

Maintenance
On each step, we know that A[1..i−1] does not contain ν. We compare it with A[i]. If they are the same, we return i, which is a correct result. Otherwise, we continue to the next step. We have already insured that A[A..i−1] does not contain ν and that A[i] is different from ν, so this step preserves the invariant.

Termination
The loop terminates when i>A.length. Since i increases by 1 and i>A.length, we know that all the elements in A have been checked and it has been found that ν is not among them. Thus, we return NIL.

2.1-4
Declaration of A, B and C:
A[0] ... A[n-1] (length = n)
B[0] ... B[n-1] (length = n)
C[0] ... C[n] (length = n+1)
A[0] and B[0] are the most significant bits. 

Pseudocode:
Carry = 0
For i = n - 1 to 0
	C[i+1] = (A[i] + B[i] + Carry) mod 2
	Carry = (A[i] + B[i] + Carry) / 2
C[0] = Carry
